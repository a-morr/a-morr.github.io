				<p>Our implementation of the ELO algorithm predicts win/loss probabilties of NBA games. <a href="/about"> Click here to read more about our methods</a></p>
				<img src="images/whiteshoe.png"/>

					<p>A sample below shows our predictions and the outcomes for games from March 13, 2017. Green and red cells indicate winners and losers in their respective
						 games. We compare our home team win percentage to FiveThirtyEights. Bolded highlights indicate a correct prediction, along with a check mark.
						 While it is very difficult to predict these games, on this day both predictions were fairly acurate. Our best methods have reached around 76% accuracy. To see these results read our page titled <a href="/AlgorithmsDiscussion">Algorithms</a>. </p>

					<p>In the last column, we included FiveThirtyEight's calculated spread, or the number of points the favored team is projected to win over the other team.
					This is to give some insight into the differences between the calculated probabilities, typically a large point spread is reflected in one team having
					a significantly higher win probability.</p>
